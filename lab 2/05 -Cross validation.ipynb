In most cases we will also not memorize the dataset. Created estimator $\\hat{F(X))}$ will be something inbetween.\n",

    "\n",
    "This problem is called Bias-Variance tradeoff. The theory behind it is well established and described with mathematical precision in the literature. Here we will focus on the intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more freedom we give to our estimator (more elasticity/variance) the easier/better it will fit the training data. Therefore it will achieve lower error (bias) on the training set. At the same time the higher the variability the higher the risk of overfitting. Although theoretically we can be lowering the expected value of error (bias) it is usually done with the increase of error variance. We can land in a situation where, when we make prediction on new data, the error is very high due to variance (even though it can be zero on average).\n",

    "## Cross Validation (CV)\n",
    "Cross validation is in the esence a process as described above. We split the data into training and validation samples. We use training data to create our estimator and validation data to check how it will work on \"new\", out of sample data.\n",
    "<img src=\"img/cv.jpg\">\n",
    "Source: Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "In such process a lot depends on the realization of the random split. The results may vary heavily on different realizations. We cannot treat the value in a single validation as a very good approximation of ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross Validation - what for?\n",
    "We use cross validation mainly  for one of two reasins:\n",
    "* Getting an objective evaluation of \"real\" effectivness of our model.\n",
    "* Tuning of models hyperparameters. Hyperaparameters are those arguments that we need to send by hand, are not part of algorithm optimization. Model complexity is often on of those hyper parameters as in the example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-Fold Cross validation (k-fold CV)\n",
    "To get more reliable evaluation of our model a k-fold cross validation is used. We repeat the process of CV K times in such a way that 1/K of all $y$ observations are used for validation and the rest for training. We repeat the procedure K times in such a way that every observation is used for validation only once.\n",
    "<img src=\"img/cvKfold.jpg\">\n",
    "Source: Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "Most common values for K are 5 or 10. In the end a result of k-fold cv is the average value of our metric across all validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Notice.* The result of k-fold cv will be different each time as the process of splitting is random.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOO CV)\n",
    "The moste extreme form of k-fold CV is Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOO CV). In this case K is equal to N, where N is total number of observations. One might think that this must be \"the best\" CV method as it is the most detailed with a lot of averaging and our training data is as big as possible each time. However, there are shortcomings. Each time our estimator will be very similar as the differences between training data are small. This decreases the value of information we get in the cv process in this case as we do not test our algorithm in \"different scenarios\" (treining sets). One important characteristic of LOO CV is that we get the same result each time we run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repeated Cross Validation\n",
    "In most cases running a k-fold CV is good enough. Sometimes however we need to get as accurate evaluation as possible. We can take advantage of the randomness and simply run k-fold several times and average the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bootstrap cross validation\n",
    "Last cv technique is bootstrap. It works by sampling with replacement N observations from our data set of N observations as training data. As we draw with replacement some observations are repeated and some are not drawn at all. The samples that have not been drawn are treated as validation set. We repeat this procedure multiple times to get the distribution of evaluation metric on validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CV Methods - which one to chose?\n",
    "There is no consensus about the best CV method. Neither among practicioners nor in academia. Theoretically it seems that k-fold (repeated) and bootstrap are two main choices. In everyday use k-fold seems most popular. It may be due to the fact that when we do bootstrap cv there is a good chance that some observations will never be part of validation set. Additionally some people see duplication of observations as an important shortcoming.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we decide to use k-fold there is one more question to answer. Should it be 5, 10 or some other k-fold? On one hand we want our training set to be as big as possible to avoid overfitting. On the other we want to have some variability of training set and stability of results in validation sets. Again, there is no one best answer and one should test different options and do repeated k-fold if more precision is needed."

    "## How to setup Cross Validation?\n",
    "Although in theory the procedure of CV is very simple, it is very easy to make mistakes that in some scenarios are very costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stratify\n",
    "One of the problems we can encounter is the balance of labels in training and validation sets. This is especially important when we work on imbalanced data. In datasets where there are few \"1\" in general it is easy to imagine a situation in which we draw no or relatively very little \"1\"s. It can lead to bias and/or big variance of our evaluation metric on the validation data set. Because of this problem we often enforce equal balance using stratification.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example in case of 5-fold cv you can imagine that we make the split for traingin and validation sets separately for \"1\"s and \"0\"s. This quarantees equal balance in both groups."

    "### Time series analysis\n",
    "The hardest dataset to set up proper cross validation is time series analysis. Due to the fact that all observations are usualy linked (not independant over time), each observation depends on previous realizations. Because of this property we cannot simply randomly draw observations into two samples and use different permutations. Observations that are next to each other in time contain simply too much information about each other to have them in different sets (train and validation).\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution is to make a natural time-based split. We use \"past\" observations as training data and \"future\" observations as validation set. Just like in the illustration below.\n",

    "### Information leakage\n",
    "Independance of observation between training and validation set is a crucial requirement for the procedure to deliver expected results. Its importance is clearly visible in time series analysis. However, it is also possible to have information leakage even in regular classification and regression problems, when the independence requirement is not met.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, when observations are not independent, we cannot treat validation set as a true *out of sample* data. This results in underestimation of error on validation set and can lead to heavy overestimation and result in a model that simply doesn't work in deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having mutiple observations for one person in our data set is one example of data structure in which it is easy to break independence of data. Other example might be usage of data from many persons from one household.\n",
    "\n",
    "The errors in setup of cross validation process are very easy to make and hard to spot. Even in competition on kaggle data leakage happens from time to time when the sets are prepared by experienced professionals. Always try to know your data and set up your CV with care."

    "## Train Validate Test\n",
    "At this point we should point to one important problem with the statements made at the begining. We said that we can use results from validation set to choose values for hyperparameters of our algorithm. However, this means that we are transfering information from validation set to training (data leakage). Doing this, if abused, can lead to biased evaluation and suboptimal model. Usually the information leakage is small and insignificant, however in cases where we heavily rely on validation set for algorithm tuning, we should use train, validate, test procedure. The idea is exactly the same as in validation but we add one more step. We save part of the data (test) at the begining that we do not use at all in training process. Then, in the end, when everything is ready we test our model with it.\n",

    "* Separating the test set decreases the number of observations in our training set. It increases the risk of overfitting and cen results in a worse predictive power of our model.\n",
    "* In a basic approach we separate only one part of the set as test. This means that we rely again on one realization of some  random process. This means that we can get very different results reach time even if we repeat whole training procedure exactly the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aforementioned problems have two possible solutions. We can do a k-fold train-test/validate. It reduces the variance of the results in test set. On the other hand, it increases the complexity of our ML pipeline and does not alleviate the problem of reduced number of observations for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively we can say that our real test set will come later. We will simply wait for new data from the market that will be generated at the time of our model creation. This type of test data is perfect as it comes from the future. This is often a good choice as correctly implemented repeated k-fold cv should bu fully sufficient to chose the best model and optimize its hyperparameters.\n",
